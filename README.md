# Portfolio

A portfolio website so I can go to college.

As of writing this/starting this (February 4, 2023), I did not know how to use
[React](https://reactjs.org/), nor [TypeScript]
(https://www.typescriptlang.org/), nor CSS, nor HTML. BUTT, I did used them
before for a little bit.

To be honest, I dislike fullstack web-development. I like backend development
better because frontend libraries are too abstracted. I hate how I don't know
how the libraries internally work. I mean, I can figure it out in a couple
seconds, and I do (I'm trying to flex by the way), but I still hate how it's
not in front of me. If you understand what I'm talking about, be my friend. I
also hate frontend development because of styling. I am a perfectionist when it
comes to styling, customizing, tweaking variables, et cetra. This is a gift and
a curse because I spend so much time trying to get a specific look on something
rather than spending time doing the important things.
